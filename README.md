🔭 I'm a software developer who spends a lot of free time learning new technology.<br>
🧸 I'm proud of who I am, what I have built, and what I am building.<br>
✍🏾 I have more than 2x the number of private repositories than I do public repositories<br>
🧑‍💻 Coding is my passion.<br>
📫 The best way to reach me is to send me an email.<br>
⚡ Fun fact: The first web framework I learned was Django and I haven't used it since.
